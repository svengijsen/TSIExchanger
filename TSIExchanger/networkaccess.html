		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The network interface opens custom access to data that is internally 
		used by Turbo-Satori (TSI) during and after real-time processing 
		including information of ROI, design matrix, (pre-processed) raw data 
		and statistical information inclusive the content of the design matrix, 
		beta maps and contrast t-maps. This plugin allows to perform additional 
		operations and calculations outside the TSI.<br />
		Well defined access queries are used to get access to the data via a TCP 
		connection. Therefore a server implementation allows to get access to 
		the whole data that is also provided by the plugin interface during and 
		after the real-time processing.<br />
		A server client approach is used to get access to the data at any time. 
		Therefore the server provides all features to get access to the data in 
		real-time while running the analysis.<br />
		Send a data specific query to get the requested information from the 
		server. </p>
		<h2>Connect to the server</h2>
		<p>A connection to the server could be established through a TCP socket 
		implementation. At first the specific server port has to be defined in 
		the plugin. After that the IP of the server will be displayed in the 
		plugin window. The ports range from 1 to 65535 but the first 1024 
		well-known ports or system ports are used by system processes and need 
		superuser privileges on Unix-like systems to bind a network socket to 
		it. Be sure to use a TCP socket to connect the server.<br />
		The plugin uses two different sockets. One to receive and answer the 
		queries from the client and one to send execution information from the 
		TSI. To specify the socket to use send a ("Request Socket") char array 
		for the query socket or a ("Execute Socket") char array for the 
		execution information socket (prepend the size of the array as a 4 byte 
		unsigned integer for all char arrays and end the array with a NUL [\0]). 
		Include the specific char array into a byte array and insert as the 
		first element the size of the byte array as an 8 byte signed 64bit 
		integer. An example byte based representation is shown below: <br />

<img src="images/image002.png" alt="" class="img-responsive centered" id="Diagram 2"><br />
		</p>

		<p>If the request is wrong the connection will be closed. Insert a short 
		delay from around 0.5 seconds between the different socket connection 
		requests to be ensure that the server is listening for a new connection.<br />
		After the connection is completely established the data can be directly 
		accessed from TSI. Only ask for data that is already available in TSI, 
		otherwise an error message will be returned!<br />
		All data that is send and received is in <strong>big-endian</strong> 
		(network byte) <strong>byte order</strong>. </p>
		<h2>Access the data</h2>
		<p>A query with the included request of the specific data must be send 
		to the server to access the data from the TSI. Every query is defined on 
		the next pages of this guide.<br />
		A query has to be constructed as a byte array where the first element is 
		a definition of the size of the byte array as an 8 byte signed 64bit 
		integer.<br />
		The second entry defines the type of query as a char array. After that 
		follows the specific query definitions, for example the time point from 
		which to get the data. Only ask for data that are already available in 
		the TSI otherwise an error string ("Wrong request!") will be returned. </p>
		<p><br />
		<img src="images/image003.png" alt="" class="img-responsive centered" id="Diagram 3"><br />
		</p>
		<p>If the query consists of more than one parameter, attach the other 
		parameters to the query and store it in the byte array.<br />
		You will receive a byte array with the respective content as answer. 
		(The first 8 byte of the byte array represents the size of the received 
		byte array as unsigned 64bit integer.) As an example how a definition of 
		the byte array should look like, see the <strong><em>
		<a href="Doxygen/class_t_s_i_exchanger.html#a151baa02dafc8fd4c03fabf57cc3d0a6">
		tGetCurrentTimePoint</a></em></strong> function (send and receive).&nbsp; </p>

		</p>
		<h2>ExecuteTimePoint calls</h2>
		<p>Whenever new data is available a specific information will be send to 
		the client. The call is ExecuteTimePoint. The ExecuteTimePoint call will 
		be send whenever new pre-processed data is available. This invocation 
		consists of an at least 14 byte large char array followed by an integer 
		representing the current point in time of the current TSI processing. 
		Both data will be send as a byte array (The first 8 byte of the byte 
		array represents the size of the received byte array as signed 64bit 
		integer).</p>
		<h2>Wrong requests</h2>
		<p>Whenever the user sends a wrong query (for example asked for a time 
		point that has not been processed yet) a wrong request information will 
		be send to the client. The first part of the information is the 
		definition that a wrong request was asked. After that follows the 
		description which specific part of the query is wrong. The client 
		receives a 14 byte char array (‚??Wrong request!‚?ù) followed by an char 
		array including the respective error. Keep in mind that this data will 
		also be send in a byte array. (The first 8 byte of the byte array 
		represents the size of the received byte array as unsigned 64bit integer 
		and before each char array the specific length as a 4byte unsigned 
		integer.) </p>
